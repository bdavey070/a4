Testing.

I used a code a little, test a little method as suggested by Judi for the developement of this assignment.
Every function in the linkedList was written and then immediately tested with the testMain.c method.
For the testing of the linkedList.c functions, different values were thrown to the functions to check if the function acted as expected.
For testing the food diary portion of the assignment, the same code a little, test a little method was used.
The program has a test constant defined so that test lines of code will be ran when it is defined as 1.
